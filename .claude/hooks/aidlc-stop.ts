// Stop hook: enforce the forwarding loop on turn-end.
//
// This is the framework's FIRST flow-altering hook. The other framework
// hooks are advisory — they observe (audit, sensors, statusline, state
// validation) and always exit 0. The sensor-fire hook in particular carries
// an explicit advisory contract: it NEVER returns {decision: block} (its own
// contract, asserted by t95 Case 7 — not a framework ban). This hook is a
// DIFFERENT, sanctioned contract: it may emit {"decision":"block", ...} to
// keep the interactive forwarding loop running until the engine says `done`.
//
// Why it exists. The forwarding loop is the conductor (LLM) calling the engine
// for the next move, acting on it, and reporting. On the gated/interactive
// path the conductor holds the loop because only it can ask the human a
// question. If the conductor forgets to consult the engine — after a long
// conversation, or by improvising — the workflow drifts. So the loop cannot
// rest on the conductor's good behaviour: when the conductor tries to end its
// turn, this hook runs the engine (`aidlc-orchestrate next`) and, if a
// directive is still PENDING, blocks the stop and injects the directive back
// via `reason`. The conductor cannot quit until the engine answers `done`.
// Enforced by the harness, not by the LLM remembering.
//
// The reason is an ON-TASK CONTINUATION — it names the work the conductor
// still owes (run the loop, act on the directive, report), never an
// override-shaped instruction. That phrasing is the security property:
// override-shaped directives are refused by the conductor's own safety
// training, so a buggy or compromised engine can only ever CONTINUE sanctioned
// work, never hijack the session.
//
// Two bounds keep a stuck loop from trapping the session (a stuck block is the
// ONE way to trap a session, so this is the safety-critical part):
//   1. `stop_hook_active` — Claude Code sets this true when the current stop is
//      itself the product of a prior Stop-hook block. We read it as a signal
//      that we are already inside a blocked sequence.
//   2. A NO-PROGRESS counter — consecutive blocks with no intervening workflow
//      advance (no `report` ran, so the position signature is unchanged). It is
//      persisted across the rapid-fire blocks in a transient file under
//      aidlc-docs/.aidlc-stop-hook/. Under a no-progress ceiling exposed as
//      CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP, once the count reaches the cap we LET GO
//      (allow the stop). The default ceiling is run-mode aware: an unattended
//      autonomous Construction run keeps the long ceiling (8, the loop must run
//      to completion with no human to release it), while an INTERACTIVE run uses
//      a low ceiling (2, issue #365 itself recommends BLOCK_CAP=2 as the
//      workaround) so a human who just wants to pause/chat is released after one
//      nudge, not eight. When the workflow advances, the signature changes and
//      the counter resets to 0, so a healthy loop is never throttled.
//
// Four human-wait carve-outs keep the hook from punishing a turn that ended
// *because* it is waiting on the human (or is simply conversational):
//   1. The Esc interrupt is FREE: Stop hooks do not fire on user interrupt, so
//      an Esc can never be trapped — no code needed for that case.
//   2. The interactive GATE is not free: the Stop hook DOES fire when the
//      conductor ends its turn to await an `AskUserQuestion` answer. At an
//      approval gate ([?] awaiting-approval) or in the Request-Changes loop
//      ([R] revising) the engine still returns a pending run-stage (the stage is
//      in-flight, aidlc-orchestrate.ts:1161-1176), so without a carve-out the
//      hook would block and spam the forwarding-loop nudge until the cap bleeds
//      out. So when the current stage's checkbox is positively [?]/[R] we ALLOW
//      the stop (isHumanWaitStop below). Positive-confirmation only and
//      fail-open: stateless cases fall through to the cap-bounded block.
//   3. A mid-stage CLARIFYING QUESTION parks the stage at [-] in-progress — the
//      same state as a lazy quit, so [-] alone can't be carved out. But the
//      conductor must write a `<slug>-questions.md` with blank [Answer]: tags
//      before asking (stage-protocol.md §3); an unanswered tag is a positive
//      signal that a question is pending, so we ALLOW the stop then too
//      (isPendingQuestionStop below). Strictly gated: it never fires under
//      autonomous Construction (the loop must keep running there), and any miss
//      — no file, all answered, autonomous, or a read error — falls through to
//      the cap-bounded block, so a genuine mid-stage quit is still nudged.
//   4. A CONVERSATIONAL turn ends with the human's last prompt answered and NO
//      workflow-engine engagement (the conductor ran neither aidlc-orchestrate
//      nor aidlc-state since that prompt). Issue #365's broader reading: a human
//      who just wants to CHAT mid-workflow should not be nudged at all. We read
//      the harness transcript (Claude / Codex deliver `transcript_path` on the
//      Stop payload; Kiro delivers none, so this carve-out is inert there and
//      the run-mode-aware cap above is its safety net) and ALLOW the stop when
//      the most recent genuine human prompt was answered with zero engine calls
//      (isConversationalStop below). POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION only and fail-closed:
//      it never fires under autonomous Construction, and any engine call in the
//      responding turn, an unreadable transcript, no human prompt found, or any
//      parse miss falls through to the cap-bounded block. It only ever ALLOWS;
//      it can never block more.
//
// No-op outside AIDLC. The frontmatter Stop matcher scopes this to the `aidlc`
// skill, but we defend here too: with no active workflow (no aidlc-state.md
// under the project dir) we exit 0 immediately. A non-AIDLC session is NEVER
// blocked. Any unexpected error also falls through to allow the stop — failing
// open is the only safe failure mode for a hook that can otherwise trap a turn.

// --- Human-wait carve-out -----------------------------------------------------
//
// The block path punishes a conductor that quit mid-loop. But a conductor parked
// at an approval gate or in the Request-Changes loop has ALSO ended its turn with
// the engine still returning a pending directive — and from the engine's vantage
// it looks identical, because a stage in `awaiting-approval` ([?]) or `revising`
// ([R]) is still "in-flight", so `next` re-emits a run-stage for it
// (aidlc-orchestrate.ts:1161-1176). Yet these states exist BECAUSE the human was
// engaged: [?] only because a gate is open awaiting approve/reject, [R] only
// because changes were just requested. Blocking there spams the forwarding-loop
// nudge until the cap bleeds out — confusing and unprofessional at an
// interactive gate.
//
// So when the CURRENT stage's checkbox is positively in one of those states,
// allow the stop. This is the only safe widening of an allow: it can only ever
// make the hook release MORE readily, never block more.
//
// One honest caveat on [R]: the row stays `revising` across the WHOLE rework
// window (it flips back to [?] only when the conductor calls `revise`; see
// stage-protocol.md:164). So [R] covers both the human-wait prompt ("what would
// you like changed?") AND the autonomous rework edits that follow. Allowing the
// stop on [R] means a conductor that quits mid-rework is not nudged — the same
// [-]-style ambiguity we accept for in-progress, here scoped to a window the
// human just opened. It is still only ever an allow (never blocks more), and the
// dominant [R] experience is the human-wait prompt this carve-out targets.
//
// POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION ONLY. We allow ONLY when a checkbox row for the current
// slug exists AND its state is [?]/[R]. No rows, slug not found, or any other
// state → return false and fall through. [-] in-progress is NOT carved out HERE:
// it is also the normal "stage work still owed" state, indistinguishable from a
// lazy mid-stage quit by checkbox alone, so a blanket [-] carve-out would gut
// the hook. (A mid-stage [-] stage with a genuinely pending question is handled
// separately and conservatively by isPendingQuestionStop below, which keys off
// the conductor's questions file rather than checkbox state.) Any parse error
// falls through too: fail-open is the only safe failure mode for a hook that can
// otherwise trap a turn.

// --- Tier-2: pending mid-stage question carve-out -----------------------------
//
// A clarifying question asked mid-stage leaves the stage at [-] in-progress —
// the SAME checkbox state as a conductor that lazily quit, so [-] alone cannot
// be carved out (tier 1 deliberately left it to the cap). But there IS a
// conductor-emitted artifact that disambiguates: stage-protocol.md §3 mandates a
// `<slug>-questions.md` is created (Step 1) with blank `[Answer]:` tags before
// the conductor asks, and every tag is filled before the stage proceeds (Step
// 4). So a questions file with an UNANSWERED tag means a question is genuinely
// pending — the conductor is parked on the human, exactly like a gate.
//
// Two strict gates make this safe (it can still only ever ALLOW, never block
// more):
//   1. POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION — allow only when a `<slug>-questions.md` under the
//      current stage's dir (aidlc-docs/<phase>/<slug>/, mirroring memoryPathFor)
//      has at least one `[Answer]:` tag that is empty or underscores-only. No
//      file, all answered, or any read error → false (fall through to the cap).
//   2. AUTONOMY GUARD — never fires under autonomous Construction
//      (`Construction Autonomy Mode: autonomous`). There the loop MUST keep
//      running unattended (gates are skipped; a failure halt-and-asks via its
//      own path), so a stray open question must not release the stop and strand
//      the run waiting on a human who was told they weren't needed.
// Fail-open throughout: any error returns false and the cap-bounded block stands.

// True when the `<slug>-questions.md` under the stage dir has an unanswered tag.

// `aidlc/.aidlc-compose-pending` before presenting the gate (the engine's
// compose dispatch print instructs it) and deletes it on approve/reject, the
// same disk-signal discipline as tier-2's <slug>-questions.md. AUTONOMY GUARD:
// never fires under autonomous Construction (an unattended run has no human to
// answer the gate; a stray marker must not strand it). Fail-open: any read

// --- Tier-3: conversational-turn carve-out (issue #365 broader reading) -------
//
// Issue #365's literal fix is `park` (the conductor explicitly pauses the run).
// But the reported pain is broader: during an ACTIVE workflow a human who just
// wants to CHAT (ask a question, discuss a decision, course-correct) should
// not be nudged back into the forwarding loop at all. Park does not cover that
// (it is not automatic). This carve-out does: when the turn that is ending was
// CONVERSATIONAL (the most recent genuine human prompt was answered with NO
// workflow-engine engagement, i.e. the conductor ran neither aidlc-orchestrate
// nor aidlc-state since that prompt) we ALLOW the stop.
//
// The signal is the harness transcript. Claude and Codex both deliver a
// `transcript_path` on the Stop payload (Claude JSONL; Codex date-sharded
// rollout JSONL); Kiro delivers none, so on Kiro this carve-out is simply inert
// and the run-mode-aware low interactive cap (blockCap) is the safety net that
// releases a chatting human after one nudge instead of eight.
//
// Two strict gates make this safe (it can still only ever ALLOW, never block
// more), mirroring isPendingQuestionStop:
//   1. POSITIVE-CONFIRMATION: allow only on a transcript we could read that
//      shows a genuine human prompt answered with zero engine calls. A missing
//      path, unreadable file, no human prompt found, or ANY engine call in the
//      responding turn returns false (fall through to the cap-bounded block).
//   2. AUTONOMY GUARD: never fires under autonomous Construction. There the
//      loop must keep running unattended; there is no human chatting to release.
// Fail-closed throughout: any error returns false and the cap-bounded block stands.

// A workflow-engine tool call: a Bash invocation of aidlc-orchestrate/aidlc-state,
// or a tool whose name itself references aidlc. These are the calls that mean

// that answered the human disqualifies the turn from the conversational carve-out
